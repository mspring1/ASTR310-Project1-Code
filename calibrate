function [CalibratedImage] = calibrate(original, dark, normalizedflat, bias, otime, dtime)
%This function calibrates images using the equation seen in lecture (S*=(R -(tr/td)*D-B)/F). First,
%we normalize the master flat image by dividing the array by its mean. Then,
%using the aforementioned equation, we have all the elements to calibrate
%our B and V images.
CalibratedImage = (original - ((otime/dtime).*dark) - bias) ./ normalizedflat;
